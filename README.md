## What is Carrot at Dawn?
Carrot at Dawn is a cute original game which can easily be played on our website.  
All images, music, and code are written by us, NINJIN-Gaming.
## How does it work?
index.html has five canvases, one for the main screen, four for the controller.  
Main.js is the heart of this program, and it connects the other six scripts by "globalLinks" pattern. That's how Carrot at Dawn works!
## Why DAWN?
